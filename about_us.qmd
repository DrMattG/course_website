We are a group of ecologists, statisticians and everything in between, with interests in Open Science, reproducibility and transparency in Ecology.

I am a researcher in plant ecology at the University of Bergen (Norway) interested in global change impacts on alpine biodiversity and ecosystem functions. For the last eight years, I have been part of developing bioST\@TS, an online teaching and learning platform on data management and analysis for biology students. More recently, I have engaged in Open Science practice in my own research, supervision and teaching. And I organized the first Open Science Course.

I am a researcher at NINA (Norwegian Institute for Nature Research) interested in evidence-based conservation and in metascience ("the science of science"). I am a part of the Living Norway Ecological Data Network and within that project focus on developing tools (e.g. R packages, Shiny Apps, etc.) and workflows to help researchers share their data openly and to make use of open data in their research. I am a member of the ESHackathon, an interdisciplinary community of practice making evidence-based decisions easier to achieve through opensource software, and SORTEE (Society for Open, Repeatable and Transparent Ecology and Evolution).
