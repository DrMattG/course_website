I am a plant ecologist at the University of Bergen (Norway) interested in global change impacts on alpine biodiversity and ecosystem functions. For the last eight years, I have been part of developing bioST\@TS, an online teaching platform for biology students. More recently, I have engaged in Open Science practice in my own research, supervision and teaching. And I organized the first Open Science Course.
