title: "Open, Reproducible and Transparent Science in Ecology Course"
---

## Aim

Universities, journals, and funding bodies increasingly demand **open and reproducible research practices** across the scientific community. 
Research data needs to be FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable), workflows need to be reproducible, and science needs to be transparent. 
All of this aims to improve the efficiency and quality of research and thus to increase the credibility of science.

We are a group of ecologists and statisticians that want to increase the awareness of this in our community and provide education and teaching material on several subjects on open science, reproducibility and transparancey in ecology.
