    "text": "Universities, journals, and funding bodies increasingly demand open and reproducible research practices across the scientific community. Research data needs to be FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable), workflows need to be reproducible, and science needs to be transparent. All of this aims to improve the efficiency and quality of research and thus to increase the credibility of science.\nWe are a group of ecologists and statisticians in Norway that want to increase the awareness of these principles in our community and provide education and teaching material on on open science, reproducibility and transparancey in ecology."

    "text": "The Open, Reproducible and Transparent Course in Ecology offers hands-on training on best practice methods and technologies to make research more open, reproducible and transparent. The course is centred around the life-cycle of data from planning, managing, collecting, curating, analysing, publishing, storing, sharing and reusing data. It is aimed at PhD students as well as early-career researchers in ecology, who produce their own data (i.e. collect data in the field/lab), use data from others (i.e. databases) or both.\nThe first Open Science Course was held at the Finse Alpine Research Centre (Norway), in November 2022. The next course will likely be held in autumn 2023."

    "text": "Past courses\nOS course 2022, Alpine Research Station Finse in Norway\n\nIn November, we held a course on Open, Reproducible, and Transparent Science in Ecology at the Biological Research Station at Finse. The course was a collaboration between BioCEED (University of Bergen), GBIF Norway and Living Norway with teachers from NINA, NTNU, UiO and UiB. The course was aimed for PhD students and offered hands-on training, skills and knowledge on Open Science, data collection, data handling, data standards, data repositories and publishing, reproducible workflows and best practice in data analysis.\nOn Monday, 14th of November a group of students and teachers made their way slowly up the mountain to Finse. The students were an international group from Scandinavia (Norway, Sweden, Denmark), Spain, Eastern Europe (Ukraine, Belarus, Georgia), and even from Asia (Armenia, India, Tajikistan). It was unusually warm for the season, and there was no snow, which was lucky for those who were not prepared for the alpine environment.\nWhile the temperature was dropping and the wind was howling, the students were wrangling data, writing code, and executing functions. They recorded frozen species and made their own data collection to understand the importance of also recording metadata (the data around the data). They learned why reproducible workflows, using tools such as quarto, git/GitHub and targets can benefit your future self, increase collaboration and make your research more robust. And finally, they learned about GBIF, Darwin Core data standards and what it takes to meet the FAIR data standards.\nFive days later, loaded with a toolbox full of new skills the students made their way slowly down the mountain. They were happy and tired and showed a strong motivation to apply the new skills and knowledge in their own work and spread the word about Open Science among their colleagues and supervisors."
