The Open, Reproducible and Transparent Course in Ecology offers hands-on training on best practice methods and technologies to make research more open, reproducible and transparent. The course is centred around the life-cycle of data from planning, managing, collecting, curating, analysing, publishing, storing, sharing and reusing data. It is aimed at PhD students as well as early-career researchers in ecology, who produce their own data (i.e. collect data in the field/lab), use data from others (i.e. databases) or both.

## Course content

The course curriculum contains theory and interactive exercises as outlined in the table below. The teaching material is openly available (see links below) under the xx Lisence.
